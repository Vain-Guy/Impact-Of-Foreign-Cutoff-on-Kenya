    "# MODELING\n",
    "\n",
    "## PROBLEM DEFINITION AND GOALS\n",
    "\n",
    "**We aim to model, predict, and simulate foreign aid dynamics for Kenya.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### CORE MODELING OBJECTIVES\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aid Flow Stability And Volatility Analysis**  \n",
    "   - Goal: Identify which sectors, agencies, and partners are most stable, volatile, or dominant in aid delivery.  \n",
    "   - Approach:  \n",
    "     - Compute volatility metrics (rolling std, coefficient of variation).  \n",
    "     - Classify entities using unsupervised clustering or ranking.  \n",
    "     - Highlight dominant vs. emerging actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predictive And Scenario Forecasting**  \n",
    "   - Goal: Predict future funding flows or simulate policy shocks (e.g., “25% cut in USAID funding”).  \n",
    "   - Approach: \n",
    "     - Use regression models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Prophet) on aid totals.  \n",
    "     - Simulate counterfactual scenarios by adjusting model inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Forecasting And Shock Simulation**  \n",
    "   - Goal: Model aid trends across fiscal years and assess resilience to fiscal shocks.  \n",
    "   - Approach:  \n",
    "     - Time series forecasting (Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM).  \n",
    "     - Introduce synthetic shocks to test system response.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sectoral Dependency Clustering**  \n",
    "   - Goal: Cluster sectors by their dependency on foreign aid.  \n",
    "   - Approach:  \n",
    "     - Use KMeans, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering.  \n",
    "     - Base features on aid ratios and concentration metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DATA AUDIT\n",
    "\n",
    "### STRONG COLUMNS\n",
    "Provide robust quantitative and categorical anchors:\n",
    "- Temporal:** fiscal_year, transaction_date, year, quarter\n",
    "- Categorical Context: country_name, us_sector_name, us_category_name\n",
    "- Management Context: managing_subagency_or_bureau_name, funded_and_managed_by, dominant_sector_per_agency\n",
    "- Monetary & Variability Indicators:  \n",
    "  current_dollar_amount, constant_dollar_amount, total_aid_fiscal,  \n",
    "  aid_volatility, rolling_mean_3yr, rolling_std_3yr, aid_concentration_index,  \n",
    "  top3_agency_share, sector_to_total_ratio, agency_to_total_ratio,  \n",
    "  aid_per_partner, relative_aid_share, aid_std_fiscal,  \n",
    "  mean_aid_per_transaction_fiscal\n",
    "\n",
    "### COLUMNS THAT NEED ATTENTION\n",
    "- objective, transaction_type_name -> may need grouping or encoding.  \n",
    "- transaction_lag, transaction_lead -> align correctly with fiscal years.  \n",
    "- is_end_of_fiscal_year, is_holiday_quarter -> binary encoding.  \n",
    "- days_since_start_of_year -> useful for time-decay effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### COLUMNS TO DROP\n",
    "- transaction_date -> replace with derived temporal features.  \n",
    "- country_name -> constant for Kenya, can be dropped.  \n",
    "- Columns ending in _interaction -> use dimensionality reduction (PCA) or selective inclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## WORKFLOW\n",
    "\n",
    "### DATA PREPARATION\n",
    "1. Handle missingness with appropriate imputations.  \n",
    "2. Normalize skewed monetary variables (we will use log1p).  \n",
    "3. Encode categorical variables using **target encoding** or **frequency encoding**.  \n",
    "4. Aggregate aid data by **year**, **sector**, or **agency** depending on the model goal.  \n",
    "5. Split data chronologically (e.g train up to 2019, test from 2020 onward).\n",
    "\n",
    "### FEATURE ENGINEERING CONSIDERATIONS\n",
    "- Rolling averages: rolling_mean_3yr, rolling_std_3yr, sector_growth_rate, agency_growth_rate\n",
    "- Concentration & diversity: aid_concentration_index, aid_diversity_index\n",
    "- Ratios: sector_to_total_ratio, agency_to_total_ratio\n",
    "- Interaction terms: agency_sector_interaction, partner_agency_interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### TARGET PICKING\n",
    "\n",
    "| Objective | Problem Type | Model Candidates | Key Targets |\n",
    "|------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|\n",

    "| **Predictive Forecasting** | Supervised Regression | XGBoost, LightGBM, Prophet | total_aid_fiscal, constant_dollar_amount |\n",
    "| **Temporal Forecasting** | Time Series | Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM | total_aid_fiscal, sector_to_total_ratio |\n",
    "| **Sector Dependency** | Clustering | KMeans, Spectral, DBSCAN | sector_to_total_ratio, aid_per_partner, aid_concentration_index |\n",
    "\n",
    "### EVALUATION METRICS\n",
    "- **Regression Models:** RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R²  \n",
    "- **Forecasting Models:** MAPE, RMSE, Directional Accuracy  \n",
    "- **Clustering Models:** Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index  \n",
    "- **Volatility Analysis:** Rolling std comparison, stability ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "### SCENARIO SIMULATION\n",
    "Run post-model scenario experiments:\n",
    "- Introduce a **shock factor**, e.g., USAID_cut = -0.25  \n",
    "- Recompute predicted totals and compare to baseline.  \n",
    "- Measure cascading impacts by sector (sector_to_total_ratio shifts).  \n",
    "- Visualize using waterfall charts or delta bar plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VISUALS\n",
    "- **Time Series:** Aid trends per sector/agency.  \n",
    "- **Heatmaps:** Volatility or concentration over time.  \n",
    "- **Cluster Maps:** Sector dependency visualization.  \n",
    "- **Scenario Dashboards:** Policy or funding cut simulations."
