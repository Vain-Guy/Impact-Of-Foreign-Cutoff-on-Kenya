    "# 1.BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States, through USAID, has been one of Kenya’s most significant development partners — investing billions of dollars between 2010 and 2025 in critical sectors including health, education, agriculture, and economic growth. These funds have supported hospitals, schools, farmer programs, and youth empowerment initiatives that drive Kenya’s progress toward Vision 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in 2025, the U.S. government paused and reviewed most foreign aid, leading to widespread disruptions across these sectors. Health programs faced staffing shortages, agricultural support initiatives were delayed, and education and youth programs stalled. This funding freeze exposed Kenya’s deep dependency on U.S. assistance and raised urgent questions about long-term sustainability and resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This project aims to quantify the scope and consequences of USAID funding cuts across all development sectors and model what Kenya’s near future could look like if cuts persist.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 BACKGROUND\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past 15 years, USAID funding has played a pivotal role in Kenya’s social and economic development. It has supported life-saving HIV programs, teacher training, farmer resilience projects, infrastructure investments, and women’s empowerment initiatives. The 2025 aid freeze disrupted thousands of projects, affecting public service delivery, employment, and economic productivity. This moment highlights the need to analyze not just the total amount of aid Kenya receives, but how that aid is distributed, how stable it has been, and which sectors and regions are most exposed to volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By using official USAID data, this project provides a data-driven view of Kenya’s aid dependency, funding volatility, and sectoral vulnerabilities — offering insights to guide policy and strategic resilience planning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 KEY OBJECTIVES \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantify Sectoral Impacts** - \n",
    "Analyze how USAID funding has changed from 2010–2025 across key sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze Funding Patterns and Volatility** -\n",
    "Use trend analysis, time-series decomposition, and regression models to examine funding fluctuations over time — identifying periods of growth, stagnation, or decline across sectors and agencies to assess the stability and predictability of U.S. aid flows to Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Map Sectoral Dependencies and Correlations** -\n",
    "Apply exploratory data analysis and clustering to uncover relationships between sectors — showing which sectors are most dependent on specific funding sources and how funding patterns across them move together or diverge.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Forecast Future Scenarios (2026–2030)** -\n",
    "Build predictive models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to simulate what may happen if funding cuts persist — projecting potential trends in total and sectoral allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generate Policy Insights** - \n",
    "Provide actionable, evidence-based recommendations for the Government of Kenya, donors, and partners on sustainable financing and resilience strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 SUCCESS METRICS\n",
    "\n",
    "Success will be defined through a mix of technical, analytical, and policy outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Accuracy:** Achieve ≥80% predictive accuracy (R² ≥ 0.8) in forecasting aid trends and sectoral outcomes under various funding scenarios.\n",
    "2. **Data Quality:** Build a clean, verified, and reproducible dataset integrating USAID sectoral and agency-level funding data.\n",
    "3. **Insight Clarity:** Produce analyses and visualizations that clearly demonstrate relationships between donor funding changes and sectoral outcomes.\n",
    "4. **Policy Relevance:** Deliver actionable insights and recommendations for the Ministry of Planning, sectoral ministries, donors, and county governments.\n",
    "5. **Scalability:** Ensure the framework is modular and reusable, allowing integration of future data from the World Bank, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), and the Kenya Health Data Portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 KEY STAKEHOLDERS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **National Treasury & Ministry of Planning** – For strategic budgeting, donor coordination, and fiscal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ministries of Health, Education, Agriculture, and Trade** – For sectoral resilience planning and impact mitigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **USAID Kenya Mission & U.S. Embassy Nairobi** – For funding evaluation, policy reform, and future aid allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **County Governments** – For identifying vulnerable regions and developing localized development responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local NGOs, Civil Society, and Development Partners** – For advocacy, partnership alignment, and program continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Scientists and Researchers** – For advancing analytical models linking donor funding to development outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.6 RELEVANCE TO KENYA\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is crucial for Kenya’s economic resilience and development planning. By quantifying how fluctuations in USAID funding affect multiple sectors, it provides policymakers and development partners with an evidence base for decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Help prioritize sectors and counties most vulnerable to funding shocks,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support domestic resource mobilization strategies,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengthen policy dialogue between Kenya and its development partners, and\n",
    "\n",
    "- Guide the design of data-driven funding frameworks that reduce dependency and build long-term sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this analysis empowers Kenya to plan smarter, negotiate better, and secure sustainable progress even amid donor uncertainty."

Before proceeding, it is essential to examine the distributions of the fiscal year, transaction year, and transaction month to identify any underlying patterns or relationships that may inform a more accurate and data-driven imputation approach."
